# Event Manager

## Requirements

### The minimum expected requirements are the following:

* Users should be able to register an account.
* Users should be able to login/logout from the system.
* Registered users should be able to create a event.
* Registered users should be able to manage (edit, delete, ?) their events.
* Events should contain one image, a date, a description and a type (e.g. party, concert, conference, ?).
* Users should be able to search for and register in events.
* Users should not be able to register twice in the same event.
* Event owners and users that registered to an event, should be able to add comments to the event.

* The following technologies should all be used: HTML, CSS, PHP, Javascript (by means of jQuery), Ajax/JSON, PDO/SQL (using sqlite).
* The web site should be as secure as possible.
* Code should be organized and consistent.

### Some suggested extra requirements:

* Event owners should be able to decide if the event is public or private.
* Private events should not appear on searches. Users must be invited to private events.
* A forum (with threads and posts) for each event instead of a simple comment system.
* Ability to add photos to events. And maybe albuns.
* Possibility to share a event using email or a social network.
* And whatever you come up with?
